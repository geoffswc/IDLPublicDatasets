      "This is the videotaped deposition of richer Joop taken by the planets in re angle progeny cases in the United States district court for the Middle District of Florida. Jacksonville division. This deposition is being held at the offices of hunting and Williams in Richmond, Virginia on October 5th, 2011. My name is Jason Levin from US legal support and on the video specialist. The court reporter. Today is Cindy sebo also from US legal support. We're going on record at 9:00 11:00 a.m. We'll count Now State their appearances for the record Norwood Wilmer for the plaintiff. Terry Sexton for Philip Morris USA and the witness and on the telephone as well. telephones Good morning, preparing for lorillard. Tobacco company, very Arnold and Lindsay appearing on behalf of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company. Okay quarter. Please swear in the witness. Do solemnly declare our affirm under the penalties of perjury testimony should give today will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, mr. Zhu I do. Mr. Joop, would you give us your your residence or whether you're working address and tell us who you work for? I look in Richmond Virginia for Altria Client Services Altria. Is that what you said after area Altria client service. Is that is that somehow related to The Tobacco Company? We know as our as Philip Morris. It is related in that we both held as a subsidiary of my Altria Group Well art. Have you been hired by attorneys for Philip Morris Tobacco Company objective form? No. I am hired an employed by Altria client services. Do you know that you've been asked to testify in cases involving Philip Morris Tobacco Company. I've been asked to testify on behalf of Philip Morris USA. So what is your relationship to the Tobacco Company Trio Client Services is a subsidiary of the Altria Group the Altria Group. Also has as a company Philip Morris USA 30 Client Services whom employed by provides a service including rd&e to Philip Morris USA. What is our d and e mean research development and Engineering. So what is your what do you do for Philip Morris? I am the director of cigarette product development for our Trio client services and at so Who develops a Cigarettes Altria Client Services Philip Morris or what Altria Client Services develops designs maintains the cigarettes for Philip Morris USA. Was there a time when Philip Morris used to design develop its own cigarettes? Yes. How did that pass to Altria client services and checked it for a couple of years ago. The company structured a little bit differently and Altria Client Services was a subsidiary of the Altria Group and now we provide that service to Philip Morris. USA that's Philip Morris USA pay you for doing that objective form. I'm paid by Altria client services, but that's Philip Morris pay this Altria Group to design it cigarettes for there is relationships of if you will Legal relationships, but I don't pretend to understand all the nuances of of Philip Morris USA being part and hold by being hold in total by Altria Group Well, I'm just trying to get the big picture Philip Morris USA is the cigarette is that people that sell the cigarettes right? Yes. So the billions of dollars that come in from a sales of cigarettes go into Philip Morris USA objective form Philip Morris USA manufacturers and Sells the cigarettes. The money is all held through the Altria Group. I'm not a finance. I don't understand how that all works. I'm just saying that you know, you you're not saying you're in like a totally separate company from Philip Morris at that you that has nothing to do with Philip Morris cigarette sailor, right objective form. I'm certainly not saying that I have nothing to do with Philip Morris USA. I mean suddenly, I'll trick Land Services provides. These service to Philip Morris USA for the research and development of its cigarettes. And evidently Philip Morris USA evidently when the money comes in it goes to this Altria Group right objective form Foundation as far as the financial structure of the company. I'm sending on an expert in that area. But I mean it's a well-documented will publicize how Altria groups reports his earnings based on the operating companies that do sell products. So, You're saying all of this connection between Altria Group and Philip Morris the tobacco company. That's all all out there in and published right object to form. I certainly can go to the Altria Group website and it's very very clearly depicted how the companies the subsidiaries of Altria Group sets up. Who is it that makes decisions about what kind of cigarette Philip Morris is going to make Philip Morris as a Management Group have Philip Morris USA has its own chief executive officer. It has its own vice presidents of various levels of branding and so The decisions made by Philip Morris USA. And how does use what you do relate to what they do. We as as the name of the group States we provide them the service if Philip Morris USA wants a new cigarette. If you will, they will come to my group and we will provide that service to them. Well, alright did it does your group monitor the kinds of products they're making now. Yes, how long has that been going on the the structure for Altria client service about 34 years old now, so and that relationship the group I would I am parts of today used to be part of Philip Morris USA prior to them. And when did that change is about three or four years don't remember the exact dates. All right, so you used to work for Philip Morris the Tobacco Company. Right. That is correct. Philip Morris USA. Yes, then they took that your group and they moved it to another group in Altria. The created a new subsidiary Altria Client Services Under the Altria Group why they do that objective form foundation. And I don't know all the details of why they done that but we have different operating companies and it's a common practice to have a centralized in the case of research and development to provide services to different operating companies. That's a common practice within a consumer packaged goods company. Well are you what is your position with this Services Group? I am the director of cigarette product development. So you don't you don't when you say you're a director? Is that like a some kind of a manager objective form? I mean, what is the director as a director? I have a group of people who report to me. Are you an officer know that the form are there any officers? Yes. All right. So are you you do you make as a I'm just trying to figure out what the word director means is it you're not like the on the board of directors. That's a different kind of director, right? I'm not on the board of directors. Because now so you're you're a director, which means you you supervise certain things. Yes. I do supervised and you report to whom I report directly to the vice president of product design and Technology who is who gentleman named Mach Cruise? Okay, and he is a vice president at this Service Group. Yes. All right. So who is it at Philip Morris the tobacco company that makes decisions about what to do, you know what products to make but positions to take that kind of thing objective form. Filmora says a CEO. He also has vice presidents of brand and Manufacturing and other levels within their if you will it is the decision of Philip Morris USA. To make introduce Market if you will new cigarettes Etc. And of course, they will get approval through the out Rio group as well. Okay, and so is it the the show whoit, whoit the whole at either the cigarette company or Altria or whatever makes a decision on what the position of the company is going to be on on certain matters such as you know things the FDA might do and you know things that relate to Public Health objective for me. It's going to depend on the type of question the type of decision that has to be made. All right, but as far as policy sets and you've got a CEO all the archery our group. Well, you're aware that the FDA has recently enacted a rule that requires if not changed. It requires cigarettes to have nine new graphic warnings on them. Right? I'm aware of the oversight of the FDA. The whole so wherever the parts of the statute that they're implementing. Okay, and so who so somebody at the at Philip Morris when I say Philip Morris because we're dealing with cigarettes here. So I may include you know, some group that recommends things. I don't care about that, but I'm going to use a word Philip Morris in this deposition. You correct me if I'm wrong who at Philip Morris decided what position to take when the FDA came out and said you You need to put these nine graphic warnings on your product objective for me. I don't know who. As an individual exactly, but it suddenly we have a gentleman who's in charge of our Regulatory Affairs group to assure that we are compliant with the requirements of the fair Food and Drug Administration. Well, did Philip Morris decide to fight the FDA and not try to of and try to avoid putting these graphic warnings on its product injected form? No. So is EF is Philip Morris intending to put the nine graphic warnings on its products when required if the FDA makes that a requirement which it is currently and they don't change their mind. We will comply with the regulation. So did you when the when the FDA suggested that these nine warnings Graphics including Graphics go on the Go on the cigarettes. Did you make a study of the warnings to determine if they were scientifically accurate objective form? I do not know of a study we conducted. well So did you conclude that the warnings were scientifically accurate? I don't know if we didn't conduct a study. We certainly don't draw a conclusion. Either way. Well, there's lots of ways to draw a conclusion. But besides doing your own study, you can read with the FDA said you can look at their evidence and you can make a conclusion yourself catch. We certainly are a company that will comply with the law. We have obviously allowed and encouraged and committed to make comments to such rulings, but we will comply unequivocally with the requirements. Well, I I assume that you'll comply with the law. But that really wasn't exactly my question. My question was when the let's go back in time. When did the FDA first suggest my way of a notice of proposed rulemaking that it was going to require 9, excuse me. Graphic warnings. on cigarettes, roughly If I memory serves me correctly the statute requires warning labels to be placed on cigarettes exactly when the if you will the role in or the decision was made by the FDA as 21 warning labels to be put onto the packs within the last year or so. Well, so you were aware at that the FDA was going to set was going to require warnings that A for instance cigarettes are addictive tobacco can harm your children cigarettes cause fatal lung disease. Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby's smoking can kill you. accompanied by Graphics that show you know, like people dead people are real or or or acting people on oxygen and even a picture of somebody who looks like he's blowing smoke out of a tracheostomy a hole in his throat inject form your you were aware of those when the FDA suggested right again, if my memory serves me correctly in the statute is something Old for the requirements of new warning labels. I think you're doing may have even included some point suggestive wordings and since the passage of that bill in 2009, then those 91 and labels were decided upon if you will by the FDA. All right, and then the when the FDA made the suggestions in a proposal Philip Morris had the opportunity to take a look evaluate the scientific and other aspects of these and tell the FDA whether it agreed or not, right Philip Morris as with others was encouragement Coleman's on the rulemaking by the FDA has parts of the process. Well aren't the comments. Basically, I mean the comments kind of go to the to whether you agree or disagree that you want to do this objective form comments, obviously on the FDA website what exactly they Verbatim I don't pretend to remember we certainly talked about within those comments rights if you will First Amendment rights, but also the total coverage of the pack or 50% coverage of the pack. So our comments are publicly available. Well, I know but I've got you here to answer questions. So maybe we'll ask a little bit about it because you mentioned just you had comments on fifty percent availability and what your your rights you said First Amendment? Rights, if I remember the document correctly, I'd say it's been a while since I've read it. Well, what what role did you have in in making any in providing input into the scientific or sub substantive the scientific the factual correctness of These Warnings at the FDA was saying they wanted you to put on your product objective form. Personally, I did not have a role in the Commons for the package in my group. My responsibilities do not include packaging and I'm certainly not the person at the company who would discuss the merits of those warnings. Well, so there's somebody else at the company who would who would be able to say whether These Warnings at the FDA is saying you need to put on now were scientifically correct? There are certainly a group who compiled a comments back to the FDA and I like I said, that's a publicly available document. I was not policy upon solve. I should say those discussions, but just tell me how it works. I mean, there's got to be somebody at Philip Morris who Has the scientific understanding and the scientific background to to tell other people are look these are right or they're wrong check the form. We do have health science research people within our DNA group. Yes. Our DNA is your group right get the form I am pulse of the R&D of tree our client services. Okay, so the ardian so you have health science people you say you like people who would know whether these These Warnings the fda's making you put on our are correct right ejected for me. We have a health science research group. That's part of our R&D. We also have a Regulatory Affairs group and they were they if you will the group's the provided the It's back to the FDA. So did the health science group as you put it did they write up a memorandum and tell the other people look, you know, we've looked at these warnings and they're not right or looked at them and they are right objective form Foundation. I don't know of such a memo. Well, these Health Science people aren't they aren't they people that work with you? Yes, well the the the the requirement that you put graphic warnings on your on your cigarettes that covers most a lot of the package. I mean, this is not a trivial matter to Phillip Morris is I mean, it's certainly a change in the package in a fifty percent. So you're telling me that the people who work with you these Health Science people, you're not even aware of them briefing the the regulatory people on a scientific accuracy of the FDA objective form again, a comments to the FDA include everything that we compiled and gave to the FDA in regards to this topic. I don't mean to be not answering a question. I just don't recall what was included in that document. I mean Philip Morris's position or is very clear. We will comply with what the FDA thinks of the appropriate warning labels. Well. Let me ask just from your point of view. Do you believe that you're the people who by Philip Morris cigarettes are entitled to know the truth about Philip Morris is cigarettes. I think individuals are entitled to know the truth or information about any product. They buy are they entitled to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the cigarettes that they buy and smoke Jack. Warning, I'm not sure what you mean by the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but certainly I think if people want to know about any product they buy they should be able to acquire if you will facts about those products. They should be able to acquire it. Yes. What do you mean a choir? Well be able to acquire information to be able to put their hands on the information whether it's real website through an 800 number by some means Well, is there an 800 number so let me back up. So what you're saying is as far as you understand Philip Morris will comply with the FDA when it's required to do so, right. That's basically what the law says. Yes. Well, the law doesn't say you couldn't require you couldn't comply a day early does objective form. I don't think the law of the Basin states that but there are requirements that the FDA essentially has to give Authority. To any changes we make to our cigarettes now and some my understanding including the packaging. So you think that that if you wanted to put these graphic warnings on the products today, you don't think the FDA would let you objective form. I don't know the answer to that question. Well is that is is that the reason you don't have them on today objective form? It's about I understand the FDA is put a line out there of September 22nd 2012 that they're requiring these warning labels to go on there and we're currently preparing to do that. It takes quite a long effort for us to convert all of our packaging to do this. Well, let's take it step at a time. One of the warnings on here is it cigarettes are addictive right? I believe this. Yes, and you How long has the company known that objective form? I think if you if you use when we see things as a company, I'll use the website as example that's been out there for the last 10 11 years. Well, I didn't say that. Actually there's Juju I said how long has the company known it not how long have you told people to different questions? So again, if the company speaks through vehicle like the website then I would say that the company has an entity of a group of individuals is making Statement of what they know what the company knows? Well that may be mr. Zhu you draw a line between what the company admits publicly and what the company has known privately. You think they're the same thing objective form. I think a company is a legal entity. Is it not and so when a company speaks it's it's really when the company writes something down or puts it in a place like a website. So you're saying the first time that the that the Philip Morris company admitted publicly that cigarettes were addictive was when I think I would use the 1999 time frame for the website is when Philip Morris stated such. All right, and so when in fill inside Philip Morris did the company scientists know and understand that cigarettes are addictive objective form. Obviously, I can't speak for every scientist. I mean there's certainly the reclassification of the word Addiction. I mean, this is a scientific term. I know it's used as a common term, but with the reclassification of that phrase a few years earlier, if you will 10 years earlier, I don't know when every scientist came to the conclusion that cigarettes now met the new criteria, but that's why I say when the company writes it down on the website. That's when the company No, sir. Well, maybe I didn't ask clearly. So let me try again first. I didn't ask when every scientist knew it I asked when in general scientists who worked for the Philip Morris company realized perhaps in secret that cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris were addictive objective form. Again, I don't know when a scientist numerous scientists came to any of their own conclusions or beliefs of what and cigarettes met the requirements to be addictive. I certainly think if you look in from 1988 on I would say different people came to different positions at different times, but the company stated that on their websites in 1999. Well, I realize the what may or may not been on the website. I'm more I'm inquiring to clarify my question as to what happened behind the doors of Philip Morris prior to 1999 with that clarification. Can you answer the question any differently objective form? I don't think I can answer the question any differently well. Mr. Jude in 1999 as you put it when the company announced, you know this this position.Wasn't it true that around that time documents that had been previously secret were turned over to the public through in a vehicle called the master settlement agreement. Remember that objective form a cylinder remember the most of settlement agreement and and part of the Clause is a part of the agreement was making public if you will documents from companies like Philip. And that was right around that time wasn't it? I mean 1998 1999 Philip Morris was required by this settlement to put documents on this website that no one had ever seen before. Okay objective form. We will certainly required or part of the agreement. We came to with the states to make public documents. And I mean is it is it a yes to my question I said there were documents many of which the public had never seen right at the objective form. I mean, I certainly can't speak for what documents came out of what time and suddenly there were documents that we have as does any company that the public doesn't see and so, you know, those those documents were made available as part of the agreement. We reached with the state's so my question the answer to my question. Yes, you posted documents in the 1998 99 timeframe because you are required to do so on the website that had never been seen by the public object form true or false. We came to agreement with the states and part of the agreement was to make available and documents of which we've made Millions available since that day that was part of the agreement we reached and and my question included the statement that at these many of these documents had never been seen by the public true or false objective form. I would have to say that some if not many of the documents and never been seen by the public because they were were files data company didn't think we would need it to be publicly available as many companies don't have such. So now you're saying that the only reason that you did not post the formerly secret documents before required to do so in the settlement agreement was Just didn't think the public needed to see you object to form this characterizes the witnesses test. I certainly don't think that you know, I conveyed that answer in that manner. We certainly publish a lot of our research and so really that is the vehicle for a lot of our information to get into if you will the scientific and the public field that not every document a company has whether it's full of Morris or any other company is available to the public. Well, if one of your scientists inside Philip Morris Had concluded in 1972 that nicotine was addictive. And written extensively about how nicotine is the reason that people smoke would that document be something the public would have liked to seen before you were made the publishing objective form. I don't know what the public would have liked to have seen to still answer your question. But again research has been published over the years. And so whether it's worthy of publication that really relies on the You're working with well regardless of whether it's worthy of publication or whether it's just an opinion of one of your scientists of the time. Do you think the public deserves to know what your scientists are thinking about the product that you make objective form? I think we use a Publications very well. I think we publish to the scientific Community. That's what science is. It moves knowledgeful would and and how that is understood by the public. It is a very different question altogether. Well, if you're if you're scientists in secret say nicotine is addictive in 1972 before much of the scientific Community understood that why didn't you publish why didn't you tell people that that's that was your thinking objected to form? You know, I don't know. I mean you making up if you will. Hypothetically, I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there is information that we publish as a new on all topics Well, that wasn't my question. But do you deny that your scientists inside your own Laboratories in the 1970s? Concluded that nicotine was addictive objective form. I don't know. You know what you're referring to as to scientists States and such but I'll be glad to review some if you have it. Well, I wasn't my question. Let's if you know it if we can do a question and answer will get out. Do you deny you sitting here today? You've got a knowledge of these company documents. Don't you objective form for me to sit here and tell you that I know of every company documents. Would certainly be a mischaracterization. I just don't know of the document or the scientist or the topic you're referring to. Well, let's do what you do know you certainly have had access now to these documents that used to be secret. In fact, they you know, they've been out now on the website for over 10 years. I'm trying to form I have access to as many people well and ask for many people you're here being tested here here giving testimony right and he had to give his testimony. Oh, yes show you have access and not only do the stuff that's on the website. But the everything in the company right objective form. I have access to the website. Obviously I've access to information that is within the company as well. Yeah, so you you I'm sure when you come in, you know to testify about what the company did you've looked back and look at these documents to see what they say. What did the scientists say that was that was Secret at the time but now Is available right objective form as part of my job. I have something to look back at a lot of research that was done before I was at the company. I can't sit here and tell you that I've read every single document that is available on the website. As I said, there are millions of documents. I didn't ask that I asked whether you denied that scientists from Philip Morris in the 1970s concluded that nicotine was addictive and those Comments were kept secret. That's what I'm asking you admit or deny. If you can't objective form answer. The question is I'd like to discuss with you what document you're talking about? I don't know what document or what scientists you're talking about. Therefore. I cannot accept nor deny. Well based on your review. Do you agree or disagree? We're their scientists your knowledge who declared nicotine was addictive wrote about it and those documents were PepsiCo objective stomach I think it was a lot of work was done around nicotine. I mean, there's no question that nicotine has been studied by scientists at Philip Morris. Now whether nicotine met the criteria for billion addictive in cigarettes is a different question altogether and so did they study the addictive nature of nicotine that they study the dependence of nicotine as many studied that I think the answer to that question is yes, many have studied it. All right. Did they write about it inside a Philip Morris? I checked the form we've certainly studied and kept that research on that topic. Okay, and who were the chief scientist at Philip Morris had studied nicotine in the 70s objective form. I don't remember names sitting there anything in the 70s you remember any of the names?I mean as far as names of who was in charge or in vice president of Rd who were the scientists? I mean, I think you've got people I was doing was working at the company that time had a role with an hour and D Thomas. Oz D may have also read books by Bill Dunn who was studying effects build on do unn? Yes, so you've read Publications or rather internal memoranda by Bill Dunn injection mischaracterizes what the witness just said well, hang on hang on because if we do that we've been getting along well. But if we start with speaking objections that that tell the witness or Q the witness that he's not supposed to agree because you say it mischaracterizes we will not get along. And so I wonder if we can come to some agreement in this deposition that we will not we will do that. You know, we will not do that because our Florida rules are very strict about there being only objections to form and and you're a good guy and I want to Along with you, but I we really can't have you know, that kind of thing. That's just I apologize if I took more words underneath to objection mischaracterizes the witnesses proper testimony, which I think is a proper objection under the Florida. No it isn't it isn't you can't instruct him by virtue of your that that somehow that was not what he's supposed to agree with. I mean I disagree with you that you can say it mischaracterized. I believe you can say I object to the form of the question if I asked and I say, please Rukmi how I can correct the form. I think then I've asked but other than that, we're pretty clear we can't do that. I would like to also to offer you the the courtesy of having a continuous form objection since I would take the risk that I would ask good questions or not, but you don't have to agree with that. But I will I will not be able to restrain myself if we have you know, discussions like that and I And I mean that trying to get along I'm trying to get along too. Good. Okay. Well, let's go forward to we do. Alright, so I'm back to I'm back to my question. So Bill Dunn who was Bill Dunn? He was a scientist and Philip Morris. What did he study Bill Dunn had many years of Philip Morris. One of the things he studied was nicotine. When did he start studying? I don't know that sitting here. Is he alive? No, did you ever talk to him? And the when did he die about three weeks ago understand? Sorry. When was the last time he worked for Philip Morris? I don't know. Well, so, you know him through his writings, right? Yes, and he wrote about nicotine and and he wrote that it was it was part of his writing about why people smoke right? He wrote and published a lot on nicotine and behaviors upon of the books. He published was called motives and incentives as a compilation of he's and others work on on smoking and what was his fundamental conclusion about why people smoked I don't know if I could really stay for you as fundamental complete conclusion. There was a lot of Behavioral aspects to why people smokers we understand that today and for some people they do indeed smoke for nicotine for some people. Yes. Well now public health authorities have looked into this in some depth have they not since then how many people smoke for nicotine objective form public health is something he studied nicotine. Well again, that wasn't my question. I mean do you my question was public health authorities have looked in some depth since As you put it Bill Dunn's writing on the issue of how many people smoke because they need the nicotine right objective form the Philip. Excuse me. The Public Health Community has studied nicotine addiction for many years. And do you think that the public health communities conclusion today? Is it oh some people smoke for nicotine really think that's accurate. I don't know what I would point to as the combined in statement of the Public Health Community suddenly have read a lot of this stuff Publications and information and suddenly they don't espouse that everybody. Smokes for nicotine so some not everybody whichever way you want to phrase it. How about 80% of regular cigarette users are addicted that fair objective form. I don't I haven't certainly not someone who studies nicotine or nor am I an addiction expert but what I've read in the Public Health Community is that some people are addicted and some people are addicted to nicotine. Well, that was my question. So let's say If you if you are tell me as a scientist what percentage of people in the United States today are that smoke are addicted to nicotine objective form as someone who doesn't study addiction. I don't know that answer. Well, isn't that a pretty important question to anybody who's interested in the health effects of cigarettes object to form. I think the question is smoking addictive. The answer is yes, my job at the company is something to try and reduce the home of cigarettes and home being the diseases that it causes like lung cancer cardiovascular disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and others. That's what I do for Philip Morris. All right. My question was is it pretty important? Whether eighty percent of the people who use cigarettes are addictive versus let's say if only 10% were objective form again, I think understanding people understanding addiction that is a field for people who do study that area and if people are looking for different reasons to help people quit understanding the behaviors what motivates them to quit Etc is a very important thing the importance I apply. Reducing risk of cigarettes is to try and reduce the harm associated with the constituents with the exposure. Well, so you're telling me as you sit here today. You don't know what percentage of people have been even estimated by the Surgeon General by the National Cancer Institute as being addicted who smoke cigarettes and the United States you again, I'm gonna be glad to look at those documents you're referring to but again, it's yes, there are estimates from National Cancer Institute. There are estimates in the surgeon general's I'm just telling you I don't study that area and I've got no information that would would question what they conclude. Well, alright, so you're operating assumption As you move forward you're involved in in like designing and and producing cigarettes for sale, right the United States, right? Yes. Now are you saying that nicotine addiction is not part of what you need to know about to design cigarette. There's no question. The cigarettes are addictive cigarettes. I think we really are inherently addictive because for many reasons and my job is really the importance we bring to our role is to try and reduce the risk of smoking cigarettes by reducing ones exposure to those chemicals and smoke the calls. The disease's I just listed. All right. So have you attempted to do design and develop a non-addictive cigarette get the form I think all cigarettes are addictive and I don't think there's any question to that again the work we've done is try and reduce the risk of cigarettes by reducing exposure to these other chemicals. I'm sorry that my questions aren't clear if they're not but I thought I asked pretty good. Have you tried to design a non-addictive cigarette? Can you answer objective form? I have never worked. On a project that is that its objective would be to reduce the addictive nature of a cigarette. Well, you would know about these projects right objective or if they existed right? Generally I would know. Yes. So now you're telling me Phillip Morris has not ever tried to develop a non-addictive cigarette. The form again. Philip Morris is attempts have been trying to reduce the risk of cigarettes by reducing other constituents now, have we had an objective to My knowledge of trying to reduce the addictive nature of a cigarette. I don't know if such a project why not again, I think it goes back to what I said the importance we put into reducing the risk is to reducing the risk of things like lung cancer cardiovascular disease. I don't understand. Let's it's fine for you to try and reduce the lung cancer. My question was why don't you try and produce a non-addictive cigarette again? Our approach has been to reduce risks in other ways and that is not been something that we have said is what we could actually achieve within a cigarette. Well one step at a time you said will your approach is a different approach? Are you telling me you don't have enough money to do both objective form? No, I think from my my experience Philip Morris. We have said we will reduce the risk of smoking by reducing the opportunity the chances of these diseases the to reduce the addictive nature of a cigarette then that is a obviously a very different objective and we have put our resources if you will our responsibility aspect for my company and to helping people quit Well, let's let's start one to one thing at a time. You said that you had not tried to develop you being Philip Morris had not tried to develop a non-addictive cigarette. So are you saying you don't have the resources to try and develop a non-addictive cigarette? No, I didn't say that. We didn't have the resources. All right, so granted that you're alright. So now you've got some program you say I'm we're going to try to make cigarettes not cause lung cancer, right? Yes, you fail they cause lung cancer right objective form cigarettes. Cause lung cancer the cigarettes you sell today in September or October have night of 2011 cause lung cancer right objective form cigarettes today still cause lung cancer. That is correct. And that's not through anything other than it's not because of a lack of trying well fine. And then you say well we've tried to keep we've tried to make cigarettes. So they don't cause emphysema and chronic bronchitis. You failed they cause Emphysema and they cause chronic bronchitis correct objective when we have been numerous resources and time working on reducing the risk of cigarettes. But again, we have not been able to produce a cigarette the reduces or eliminates. I should say emphysema bronchitis or have we been successful in generating they safe cigarette. How many brands does Phillip Morris make? Two hundred thousand and two dozen. I don't know the count exactly. Give me five Marlborough Parliament Benson & Hedges Ellen M. Basic. All right is a Marlboro does a Marlboro cause less or more lung cancer than a parliament objective for him. I don't have an answer that question. There is no way of answering that questions cigarettes unquestionably be cools lung cancer. Well, they have any brand. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I never interrupt deliberately. I really do. If I do it's I will immediately stop and let him so okay put yourself in his I don't interrupt with. Okay. Okay. No problem. You please go ahead thank you. We certainly have implemented it with a no less cigarette designs features to try and reduce exposure. There is no cigarette that is safe. There is no cigarette that doesn't produce lung cancer. We have tried to reduce exposure and and we have been successful. I believe in reducing some of the risk associated but not have we been successful. Is when eliminating the risk, are you telling us that there are some Brands you make that are safer than others? I think if you excuse me if you realize that smokers. Disease chances go up with exposure and if you reduce ones exposure to smoke then some of our cigarettes we know reduce the exposure now of smoke to smokers some of your cigarettes reduce the exposure to smoke. Yes. Well that let me rephrase that. I mean relative to what's currently on the market others reducing some reduce exposure more than others. How do they do that? Only if you go back through science and time the Advent of something like filters and these other design changes. The literature is very complete on reducing the risk of things like lung cancer. So reducing the amount of smokers Smoke Gets coming from non-filter cigarettes to filtered cigarette as reduce some of the Again, there are no cigarettes. Well, my question is if there are brands that are safer than others which brands are those objective form. I believe in the less is better. The last what less smoke is better than exposure to the constituents to the thousands of chemicals and smoke. Well, okay. Tell me let's say I'm a I'm a customer I don't want to get lung cancer. I don't want to die of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. I don't want to die of heart disease, but I'm addicted to smoking so I call you up on the phone and I say mr. Joo you're a scientist. You're an expert tell me are there Brands you make that are going to that are better. For me than other brands what he's going to say subject to form. First couple of things. I mean we certainly do not talk to adult smokers about the health effects or benefits or anything associated with our cigarettes the many years. We've deferred to the public health to be the only people speaking to the public the only people speak in the public on the health effects of smoking. We don't have that type of public conversation with smokers. We don't do that that is a policy and so we rely on the Public Health Community so that Question would not be answered. If you call me up today. Well, I'm not asking you whether the the cigarettes cause cancer. I'm asking you what you are the one that make them different brands. You're the guys that know what's in these cigarettes. You're the guys who put the stuff in it. You're the guys who do the testing tell me if you got a brand that safer. Let me know what it is. What is it objective one again. We point to the Public Health Community. I'm not trying Avoid answering your question. The Public Health Community has a message to Smoker's the message is relatively simple is don't start and if you do smoke that is to quit there is nothing else that the Public Health Community currently communicates the smokers and so that is the message we would give the smokers is by points in them to the Public Health Community. We wouldn't answer that question. You can't answer you mean you your testimony is you spent all this time doing this research to Deuce say for cigarettes. And now you say you can't even tell the public if they call which ones are safer objective form. I think I company's position on communicating the public is very very clear. It's very clear that we point them directly and solely to the Public Health Community. Well, I just looked at the 2010 Surgeon General report didn't say that you had some brands of cigarettes that were supposedly safer than others did does it the surgeon general's report? Your us does not state. Differences among cigarettes you're asking me my opinion and prior question. And so I think the surgeon general's report is message. There is again, please don't smoke and if you do smoke quit, so I'm back to that. I'd like to find a brand you make more than one brand right? Yes are they are there differences in the health effects of these Brands I think will cigarettes a very dangerous. I think over time we've learned that one's exposure to smoke will drive diseases like lung cancer. Ultra and in my opinion if you smoke a cigarette with a lower amount of smoke a lower Tom lower lower machine measured time, you're exposing yourself to less and less. So in my opinion, I think those cigarettes will reduce the risk of cigarettes today, but produce a high amount of smoke if you will. Well, okay. You said a couple things number one. You said you have certain cigarettes that produce a lower amount of machine measured tar. Is that right? Yes. I said that on a smoking. Oisin, right? Yes. All right. So which ones are those before we get into the question of whether that is what people really get let's talk about well, which ones I'll pick one month Merit bronze Merit bronze. All right. So now do you have you have a package of Merit bronze on you know, I do not have any cigarettes on you know, you smoked. Yes. Smoke cigarettes. Yes today. Yes, how much do you smoke less than a pack a day? What does that mean less than if there is I mean some days I've made smoke 30 or 40 other days. I don't smoke any so you smoke like 2 packs and Sunday. Hmm. Yes, I do. Excuse me. What kind of cigarettes do you smoke if there is how you see stick with Marlborough and a red pack. Well, there are different kinds of Marlboros aren't there the Sarah so When you say it a red pack not knowing anything about smoking what cigarette is that? It's called mole bruh box. Marlboro box that's the name we give it. Okay. So do you smoke these Marlboro boxes is your company smoke them on a machine to make a measurement? Yes, you get that if you have a cough or anything, you need to take a break there. No, I'm good. Scuse me. Got a tickle. Okay, and if you need to smoke, you didn't tell me again. Well, I'm good. Thank you break. All right. All right. So so somewhere in the company somebody takes these Marlboro Reds are the Reds. I can't remember. I'm sorry Marlboro Red Box we can call them over revs if you if you wish Marlboro Reds. All right, and they smoke them on a machine to measure what's what how much smoke they deliver. Yes. So, where would I get that number? We would give that number to the Federal Trade Commission. We give that number to the FDA but we don't use that number and enter have our advertising or Communications. Well, I mean you told me it would be you thought it would be better if people had smoked the cigarettes that gave less Smoke on the machine. So now I'm saying well, okay. The Marlboro Reds, so I want to I want to have a table here of how much smoke they give on the machine. So how much where would someone know how much smoke the Red cigarette gave on the machine currently that is not communicated. And again, you know, you asked me my opinion. But again, we point to the public health and that is not something that the public health think should be communicated the smokers. You're saying you're not allowed to tell them objective form how much smoke comes out of that thing on the machine objective for me. We have been on this for many years to include that number in our advertising. We have no longer use that number in our appetizer. Well, I know but I could interpret that different ways. Are you saying that the government stops you from using it or that you just don't you're not no longer requires you from using? Adjective 1 I don't know sorry the legalities of what the government States on something like that and I'm certainly not part of a group that would know that sorry. Well, alright, so you don't tell anybody how much vote right? We don't we don't communicate to the public in any way the tan numbers Etc from a machine measurements measurements and there are different cigarettes Marlboros that give less Smoke on the machine different mowbray's would yield different amount of smoke on the machine? Yes, just give me for example, what other kinds of Marlboros are are there are. Of a talked about Marlboro Red if you will there's more brand Special Blend as mobile gold. There's mobile Silva. There's more bruh menthol. So is Barbara gold does that have less smoke than Marlboro Red? Yes on a machine. Yes. How would anyone know that currently today? I don't know how people would know that. Like I said, we give that information to the Federal Trade commission's and they requested. We also have given those numbers to the FDA. All right, it's a good time to take a break changed on off record at 10:06 a.m. See in a take one.\n"
