I thought I think if I tried to quit now, which I'm planning to at some point this year, I don't know how I would go about it. Once you're smoking or anything can be a trigger, I had a drink, I was a cigarette, I'm stressed out, I wanted a cigarette. There's just kind of like a extension of my hand, like over there. Yeah, that's for the 30 year old alcohol, the reality is, it's all that. Like everything's going to kill you, everything's bad, and then somebody like me might have won cancer, like, you know, the damage is done at this point.

And then you've done the business back to square one, you have to. But yeah, and then you sort of talk yourself around like, no, I won't quit yet. I enjoy it all quit soon. I know this would draw my smoke more. I get in my car on my way to work, to have a cup of coffee and smoke cigarette that is the relief it I even missed a train. I was so serious.

So he all seen me behind his high coat. I should have worn higher heels today. So I'm sure the arm will hurt his shirt full and have been in it. I spent a lot of time working on advertising, privacy, security and productivity. So I've already been through the protection issues. And it's not convenient. I'm going to talk to you about advertising and promotion. We're going to cover some basics. Basic of advertising. I'm going to talk a little bit about the legal framework. And what happens when things go wrong? I'm going to give you a sense of some industry to watch out in this space. Say, if you were to be at an article last day, I'm going to be because I'm one of the vice chairs in the International Chamber of Commerce. And I sit as one of the vice chairs of their advertising marketing commission. So I've had a lot of personal experience in working on advertising quotes and standards and advertising self-regulation. So I want to share a little bit of that learning with you today. And then, and that which I just have a brief conversation about what industry can do and hopefully we'll have some time for questions. So let's start with what's advertising. advertising has a very, very broad definition. It is not as broad as all of commercial speech, but it is certainly a formal commercial speech. And it is defined as in wax-launch areas. The action of drawing the public's attention to something to promote its sale. So when we think about advertising and advertising policy, I like to think about it in terms of calls to action. What a lot of the consumer groups and the activists say is that branding equals advertising. That is not true. Branding is component advertising. Branding identify source or origin of products, but it does not for saying necessarily advertising. But that line between branding and advertising can be a fuzzy one when it comes to sin categories and products. And if you have the volume sin category, where we find advertising in all media, we find it a crypt, broadcasting table, online banner as, mailers, emails, websites, product labels in storage display. Your technical volumes can be a foreign advertising. What we often see it and we get some really interesting functions from clients in a variety of sectors about how it's just a technical volume. But you end up making claims about what products and these technical volumes which can be of all of advertising. And then of course, social media pages and public, your Twitter feature advertising, your Facebook post, your advertising. And there's some very interesting elements of advertising and policy and practice that you have to consider and you have to consider them in character-limited media, like Twitter, where you have to incorporate disclosures and disclaimers. And in fact, what we say for some of our clients, you really can't use those media because they can't accommodate the kind of disclosures that you really have to include to avoid false advertising. So what are some of the basics? I like to characterize fundamental basics of good advertising and consumer protection in two phrases. First is don't lie. Basic consumer protection. The second is being fair. Think about the impact on consumer. And so what we think about most of the issues that are within the daily work of federal trade commission and state attorney's general, those two phrases will really help guide you in developing your promotional marketing strategies. And it's essence. Advertising has to be truthful, not misleading, and substantial environmental basis. The substantial piece often trips people, you know, a lot of questions about claims like Calvaryt happened is the greatest law firm on the planet. That is probably what we call poverty. No one is going to leave all of these issues. Calvaryt happened as a greatest law firm on planet. But if I say that my e-sigarette has the smoothest taste, has the most choices, it's the best cigarette on the market. That's a performance claim. Because it's modified by those other elements and claims. So when we look at advertising, the other component is we look at the net impact on poverty. So every element of your ad, including figures, including phrases, including video, audio, all of that fills the net impression of the asset. We review ads for what we call clearance. We will clearance. We have to look at the ad. We look at all the components of the ad. So when I come back to the point of substation, certain claims have to be substated by every single basis. Interfacically performance claims. So if I say my e-sigarette has the lowest price in the animal in the category, you have to be able to back that up. Right? And you have to look at everyone in the category to back up that claim. If you say we have the best prices in the Washington D.C. market, then you look at the Washington D.C. market for your price in the lives. Similarly, if you're making any type of safety of the performance claim, you have to back that up. Now when we're making health and safety in the way of claims, the important substation is characterized legally as constant and reliable scientific evidence. That means you have to have support. And there have been a variety of decisions by the federal trade friction and some core decisions that have helped describe what that is. A lot of those claims relate to food category, dietary supplements, et cetera. And the issue becomes testing that is conducted on an ingredient does not always support claims for the entire product. And the courts have upheld the notion that you have to have randomized clinical trials to support certain claims for the preference for various commissions here in the U.S. studies. So when we think about those highly specific technical claims, we want to look at the competent and reliable scientific evidence. Now the last point is one of the most important complaints. Clank your all interpreted from the perspective of the reasonable consumer who is the target of your app. So you look at the target. If you're targeting a BV audience, you tend to assume that it's somewhat more sophisticated business audience for your claims. And you're going to make certain claims irrelevant to a BV audience that may not be as important to consumer audience and vice versa. And we look at consumer oriented claims. We look at it from the perspective of those reasonable consumer user target that. The point about substantiation, though, can sometimes be intention with the consumer takeaway. We see this with clients in claims like environmental claims, for example, where consumers may have a perception that is actually not grounded on scientific fact. And that is an area where I think it creates a lot of concerns for us as lawyers, where we have to work through some of those issues. There are also particular points that we work with scientists on. And I'm going to give you an example of one. We had a client a couple years ago who was making energy claims for a product to your category of a thousand court. And they had done some studies. And they came up with claims that said, you will achieve up to 70% savings on your energy bill. And we said, let's look at the data. So the blue pulling, we got the data. And we got this nice spread. So again, it's chart. And yes, sure not, there's one data point that was right in about 66.2%. Most of the other data points were well below that. And we had a discussion with the scientists and staff who kept saying, but here's the data. It's up to this. Up to claims are not accepted by the OTC because they have a super perception evidence that says, if you make an up to claim, the consumer's from thing, for that product, they won't actually get that little informant. And so if you say our product will reduce the amount of x-battered reading by up to y%, don't make that claim. Unless all of your data is right around that number, and a very tight single, you can't support that claim. And those are the kinds of discussions that we end up having an attempt to face is with our clients when we're looking at the application for mice. Okay, so let me move to the US legal framework. So what laws apply? Obviously, the Federal Trade Commission act FTC action by regulates consumer protection and competition, including advertising, and section five from PIVITS, unfair or accepted acts or practices in Congress. That is, as you can understand by my describing it, an extremely broad statement of law, and under that umbrella, are many policy guidance documents, enforcement guidelines, and case decisions, I'm a federal trade commission that help illuminate what that means in specific circumstances. It's worth noting that there are special trade regulation rules on particular products. There's one on energy guys, there's one on their own isolation, there's also guidelines like the green guys, the guys who use them in our work in claims, and the FTC's testimony of an endorsement guys. The latter two dives have actually been the focus of quite a bit of enforcement. The FTC, for example, also has guidance on made in the American government, and it's a very interesting way to understand the fact that the FTC is a claim that just issued a decision yesterday. It's the first decision in the Trump administration, the new acting Republican chair, Marine oil housing, leading the commission. But they said you can support these claims, and this involved a water filter product or line of products, where they may have a major American first. If you are making made in the USA claims, I would urge you to simply, and whether or not you substantially have that, because all of your substantially, substantially, all of those products, that means every component of your product has to be made in the USA for that thing to be truthful, and it is an area of enforcement focus. So that's the federal standard. We also have what we call a little FTC ass. So, almost every state in the country has laws that are mine on the federal trade commission act. It gives state attorneys general, broad enforcement power, enforcement force, unfair or deceptive action practices in Congress. A couple of states don't have any California as a problem. Even can the test tube have special laws on false advertising so that it's in New York, sort of as Massachusetts. And we look at advertising. We also think about where our state laws, where state activity, where are you vulnerable, because it's not just the federal landscape that you have to worry about. We also have what will call a land act. The land act is principally a tool used by competitors to enforce against false advertising. The land act is largely our trademark statute, but there is a false advertising provision as Section 43, and is typically used in federal false advertising cases to challenge competitor ass. So, when we look broadly, in addition to state little FTC acts, we have state false advertising and consumer potential laws. We also have special categories of laws. And so, for a variety of products, there may be very specific laws that apply to dispensing hearing aids, for example, where when we are representing a hearing aid manufacturer, we look at the state landscape to see what they can and can't do in their marketing. Bapily, if not more importantly, we have self-reheatory codes, standards, and programs. So, I want to just say a quick word about our national self-reheatory program through the National Advertising Division, which is an arm of the advertising self-reheatory council, which actually falls over the overall of the business bureau. We have a national program of advertising self-reheatory. And this is basically a system for challenging false advertising. In the US, most of these challenges are actually brought by competitors. Although you can have self-reheatory challenges by the staff at any of the different ways, this by the way is actually quite different than self-reheatory advertising programs we see around the world, or the bulk of the cases are actually filed by consumers. That actually doesn't happen here. I want to be an interesting difference in consumer protection and how consumers interface with businesses between the US and other regions, including the EU, is that consumers will complain to you. And in fact, what we often see with clients is they'll air a big broadcast campaign. And then they'll get reactions from consumers. I didn't like this. I had a client who got a big day at campaign, literally a very significant effort as a campaign. And they were trying to show diversity. And so, they have some models in the campaign in a wheelchair. They wanted a wheelchair, they have one using the cane, and they have other people. So they got some emails that said this was demeaning to people with disabilities. But they got a huge number of responses, lunchurette. It's so great to see somebody in a wheelchair using this product. And so, advertisers will look at that input. And think about managing your campaigns based on their input. But again, competitors tend to file challenges in our self-reheatory system. You ask not to come in any view for example, or the bulk of them are consumers. The other big difference here is that we have one of our favorite things, consumer, auspicious suits. Consumer class actions are more of a unique feature of the US landscape, compared to the rest of the world for color reasons. One, we truly have an avenue system. Most of the jurisdictions often wears our officers in the court. They're there to sort of get to the truth. The whole of the entire client privilege is often different, particularly within hospitals. Probably the most important element, though, is no more else in the world. We have a little discovery, also, we have in the United States of the Netherlands. The cost of discovering is what drives a class act since, because the bulk of the class act in suits are the file to forge a settlement, really, and you're doing the economic calculus that it's got to cost me more in the fight this, even a very minimal suit than it would disselect at the plaintiff's attorney's down that. One important thing to note is that a couple years ago, a group that works with the insurance industry who comes out with a court's periodically on what's happening in a litigation landscape, and it doesn't report about what's the state apply on the class act litigation. And they found that the fastwaverally categories of class act relating to the case were in two areas, privacy and desk security and advertising. Conversely, product liability suits were declining. Part of that is, if you don't have the best sense of the really big and the tobacco cases, that were a huge feature of the plaintiff's land state, the plaintiff's property is there's still a lot of claims, or a telegram. They still have houses and mortgages and kids and bills to pay. And what does that mean? They need to find lawsuits. So when we think about what's happening in the legal landscape, that is one of the reasons that we do see an uptick in both our class and class. So again, from a advisory standpoint, when we're advising clients about advertising campaigns, we think about momentarily related challenges. What is the landscape look like? Who are your competitors? Who are your religious competitors? Who's going to file a claim or a challenge or a suit? And then what is the class action bar on the thing that you think about your category? And so again, when you're in a synd category of product, you're automatically going to get more scrutiny for your claims and for your advertising than perhaps other products in very different categories. So again, that's something we keep in mind when we look at advising clients on advertising. And then there's what I call shadow regulation. We certainly see this with different standards, product performance standards, social responsibility standards. So every big box retailer has their own level of standards. They may have their own codes, they may have their own additional test requirements. So if you have to mean a specific test, they may say, well, you don't know where to mean this test, but you have to make these other tests. So those are important in the advertising arena. The other thing you have to think about are publisher and media standards. So any pretty publisher broadcast publisher, any most big online publishers have guidelines for advertising. There are certain products that they will advertise for them will restrict. And the online media, for example, you know, there are publishers who are known as product research and then except for a graphic as, but there are usually restrictions on you and you those as. So for alcohol to back of some of those products, where there are limits on who can buy the product. And then the publisher guidelines will typically include restrictions on how to advertise those products in which lines of the publishers. Content are suitable for airing or showing ads for those products. So we've worked with actually a couple of publishers that have a couple of years to help them to know standards. And publisher guidelines for. E cigarette advertising. There's some concern about it. They don't want to be lighting rods, but obviously they want the revenues. And so good strong appropriate. E cigarette advertising can be accepted. And you can do all good and powerful ads and use a variety of venues. If you have good standards for your ads. There are also monetary standards for advertising in different industry sectors. And I'm going to come back to that point at the end because that has been a very, very, very, very cool for a number of industry sectors in other tech for their advertising. The final influencer is the media. And so the media shapes consumer perception. So when I talked earlier about advertising is interpreted from the eyes of the least consumer. I mean, look at the question of the ad. The reasonable consumer perception is going to be shaped by what the media says about the product of the network. And so part of the industry strategy for clients that we work with is sometimes not just working on the ad campaigns, but working with them on their PR messaging. We do represent a lot of trade associations in the app for many years. And we are very accustomed to working with industry sectors. We help advance a message of responsibility and a commitment to a successful advertising for people that are not so many issues with concern. And so again, you want to think about this and crafting your own messaging strategy. Because all of those things are either legal requirements or influence how your advertising is growing. So let's come back to some of the basics. I talked earlier about this extension. So in addition to having a common and reliable evidence to support your claim, advertisers and ad agencies. Anyone who's involved in the advertising stream of covers has to have a reasonable basis to support the clients. They also, that means you have to have a good order to disseminate the ad. And one of the common issues we have is here's our claim we've watched this campaign and I'll say, okay, rich extension. Well, we're still working on that. Now, how good enough. We really have to have your substantiation in hand before we have this air orphaned. And I talked about the material claim. So price performance safety also environmental impacts. We work with a variety of plans on environmental claims. I can observe that so much in this sector, but for food industry packaging industry for a lot of his student product companies that we work with their very focused on our own claims. Again, there's a little bit of a difference in how his tumors react to claims. So for example, we see a lot of carbon-based claims in European market because European and consumers care about carbon footprints. In the US, we really don't care. We don't even understand it. Now we have a precedent who doesn't believe it. So, you know, we're in a very different landscape. And so again, what consumers care about them, what they react to is going to be different. But environmental impact claims like these other claims have to be supported. And again, I talked about common and reliable scientific evidence, health claims, safety claims. Tomorrow we're going to talk a little bit about battery safety. But there's a lot of concern about any safety not just of the liquid that you're offering, but the devices themselves. And so you have safety issues which you have to look at. And can also advertise around that applied in both aspects of your products. So those are just a couple of ways to think about. So we think about the perspective of the reasonable consumer. We have to look at who's the target of the ad. Most of the time, for almost all our clients, they have multi-child marketing. But kinds of campaigns and the kind of advertising claims that they may offer to their distributors and their other need of the markets, may be very different than the claims that they're making and direct these C-s. And of course, for your category, my little picture of the family that's not your target. Those kids are not your target. It's only on debt. And so you really need to be very mindful of your target when you are crafting your advertising messages. Fill over into inappropriate audiences is one of the biggest risks I think for this industry. Looking historically, in Africa, has for some of the agreement, for example. So when we look at the perspective of the reasonable consumer, you also consider the sophistication of the audience. And then social expectations and the legal framework may affect those perceptions. I've been active as I said on the ICC marketing and advertising commission. Years ago, I was asked to present that the Organization for Economic Cooperation is relevant on the ICC, what we call the ICC framework guys on environmental marketing. And we were presenting to groups that did not just include a consumer protection ministers, but some folks from the environmental industries who were very focused on banning products to advance objectives in the environmental arena. Now the ICC's perspective, the international advertising industry perspective is you shouldn't ban products to advance social good. You may want to modify or report it's closure. You don't ban advertising. But there's a very interesting discussion about the notion one of my examples in the US. We would allow if it supported a claim for rate roger saying, my car, my rate roger is the most efficient as you need on the market. They can support that they can say it. And it was amazing that a lot of these European ministers right now, they should say that all because the category is bad and so they shouldn't even advertise. You don't have that view in the US, but if you were done to go outside the US, you really need to think about the legal framework, the societal expectations that you will be facing because they vary your campaign. So another watch out is competitive claims. Again, for newer industries where you're really entering the market, we don't often see so many competitor claims. But if you do head to head comparisons, they actually have to be a head. They actually apples now, super person. Now that doesn't mean that you can't compare your products against tobacco, for example. There are other regulatory restrictions that you need to look at. The goal is apples to apples comparison and compare faces of the claims. We share another, actually, a funny story with you, to go out where we had a plan who invented the market for a lot of time. And not in the product. They offered three tiers of products in the market. It's good that a best. The good that a best really was very good. And they were having a try to learn the market. So they're marketing teams came up with a really nice idea that they would compare their best product to their biggest competitors or product. So we worked with general counsel. We advised the client not to do that because they were keen on doing it. So we said, okay, you have to make the comparison clear. So if they have a picture, it's product F, some of the competitor and our product life. And we said, you know, you got into aggressive competitor without that product. So, you know, we don't know what happens. So what happens is the competitor saw the ad. They thought it was pretty funny. They immediately got an ad and they compared all three lines of my clients products, truthfully with their line, showing that they were better in performance in every category. And better or ask with them in price. And so my clients marketing teams, early in idea, ended up really hurrying in the marketing place. And the fact that they did not take our advice was unfortunate in that case. But again, Apple to have this comparison had to be a pair of any competitors that would be in pain. In Dorsan's and testimonials are very, very, very big focus for the third-rate question now. I don't know how many of you are really working with the Dorsers on products, but pay attention to this area. There's a lot of enforcement activity on wrapping up an enforcement manner. We have T.C. for right now that I hope people who closed out with no consent agreement and were all upset with my app. My app is easy to tell me. It's already pretty heavy about that. But there are a few special concerns about Dorsan's. You have to consider disclosures. So if there is a material connection, if you have paid somebody, including just giving them a product, that has to be disclos. And Dorsers can talk about their experience in less they actually have it. You just hire somebody to say, you know, I don't think they were a product. They actually have to be a group, right? Plains that require proof must be sustained to you. You can't assume that just because some water is blocking out your product that you can make a claim based on what the water says. That's another important watch out. We have a lot of instances where clients wear, they see things in social media. They've never asked the arm in on any relationship with them. They've never given them a product and they've never paid them. But the blogger will say something, you know, overlying. And they want to adopt it. If you adopt a claim, it is your claim. And then all the rules of advertising apply to that claim. So don't think that just because somebody else did it, you can migrate it to your website or put it in your marketing materials. If you can't support it, if you say it directly, you can adopt it with a bit of water. Probably one of the biggest concerns for you all is underage marketing. We just captured a few points from the fact that master's settlement and agreement. This is what the anti-abranding actors want to take on, but to totally agree. We'll basically, a lot of them might not want to remark at all. Unfortunately, we have first amendment as countries of action happen. They want to prohibit certain types of activities, certain types of long-term initiatives that are otherwise legal. And they want to ban or restrict certain techniques like cartoons, certain venues like intransit, outdoor advertising, product places, free samples. They want to ban those. Those are some of the restrictions that that vote industry agreed to, which faculty will ask for a second. So when you think about what could happen to your industry, look at the 1998 MSA. And then think about how you as an industry can avoid being in the crosshairs of the anti-abranding activists are responsible for marketing across. Smokey cessation claims are also specific claims that are subject to some regulatory limits. Products are conducted for therapeutic purposes. For example, products, if E-sugar and Sermarkins are product to help people who can smoking, you're regulated by FDA. Health related claims may also be regulated or restricted by FDA. And then there are specific limits on selling E-N-D-S products as a less hazardous alternative to conventional products, unless you go through an expensive review process. Now, going through that process may be worth it. And yeah, that's a business decision. Just need to know the rules so that you can manage and adapt your advertising strategies in a more importantly. One of the really interesting cases that came up a few years ago involved, I'm having a call, pop wonderful. Does anybody not have a pop-morty force, pop-morty force, pop-morty force? So they have a really funny, arctic campaign. So these are just a couple of the major callouts in their print ad. Cheek depth by drinking home remedies, life support. And we will be in the help of your if you drink home remedies. And I'm off to say, cross ways. You know, it's good for myself. All these claims were not supportive. Now, there are a couple of things that are interesting about this campaign. One is our pertinent firsthand done. They actually worked with the internal role of role-log group that ultimately was representing this company. But at the time, these types were made. They didn't have legal advice. And this is a type of campaign that could have been saved by good lawyer rate. You could have had attention getting information and then to drinking juice is not going to cheat down. But here's the benefits of the product. They over promised and they relied on some studies on ingredients and not studies on the product. So one of the lessons here is that you need to make sure that I'm supportive of the clients. It's for you to use eye-catching imagery and techniques that you need to be able to have a job. And there was a long history of back and forth on various claims in Malmum Palm. But at the end of the day, this is a decision that resulted in a court saying, you have to have at least one randomized clinical trial to support a health-related place. By the way, they have T.C. started with preparing to the court to not agree with that. But that's still a pretty big burden in the health-planes area for a certain of these products. So one of the other lessons from Palm is that, and one of the defenses is we can apply. We can apply with that to your requirements for a problem-related, etc. It does not until you, from an advertising challenge. In this case, the challenge was by her, Paula, so it was a competitor challenge. But that is equally true whether you're facing a traditional investigation and a PC investigation of consumer costs action or another account. So in other words, compliance is a requirement. It's a regular report for a poor, not a ceiling. And doesn't necessarily include simply a challenge that you're advertising clients can be supported in their challenge. So who's liable? What happens if you're in trouble? Who's liable and what can happen? So the company of course is generally the first target. You can have regulatory suits that are resolved in civil penalties, discord from profits, consumer reading, and anybody have a book-squadding diesel. Anybody look forward to getting $2,000 back? But yeah, next week. So Volkswagen has a grade to a multi-million dollar settlement. For its full-satellite-planes, about the emissions of their cars. And there's also huge reputation for them as well. If you get into a consent agreement with a regulatory money, you will have mandatory reporting. Typically at the FTC, it's annually from five years. But you're subject to an FTC consent agreement, generally for a 20-year period. And they're usually training, auditing, independent peer-release support for certain claims. And depending on the issue, you will have not just the out-of-pocket cost of defense, but you will have a multi-year oversight by a government agency before you're in place. Competitor-class action suits, of course, above-down, just a jump trip, really. Sometimes, pen and end-down, and always always always attorneys sees. That's why those price tags go up because the plaintiff's lawyers want to get paid. But individuals can also be named. So importantly, in the palm case, the Federal Trade Commission named the owners individually, the president as well as the vice-president and vice-science and regulatory affairs, individually in these cases. So particularly for closely held companies, you almost always see that the owners are named in his set of runance. So that is another reason that you do not want to be a target when you're certainly looking back to claims in health support them. So I talked earlier about the ICC code. The ICC code of advertising marketing communications practice provides general guidance on fair advertising. The ICC code is actually adopted in Medicare restrictions around the world. The true countries also have advertising laws. But, as I said, no, we're asking you all to ask the person. That is a big difference for us. When we look at instruments like in EU, there's currently under any audio control media services direct directives, which is directive regarding use of audio signal, that's generally the broadcasts. But they want to expand that to all the digital included. There are lots of events that are coming into play. Strong restrictions potentially on advertising. Children advertising have certain products. And so again, when we look at how the rest of the world looks at advertising, they don't go in the same way. So we start with the premise that advertising for legal products is legal. In the rest of the world, there's often the perspective that if we want to restrict consumption of the product, even if it is legal, then the way to do that is to also restrict advertising. So there are different approaches. There are also different approaches to penalties. We actually have very serious penalties in the US. As I said earlier, damages in judgment really consume and we address, et cetera. We don't always see that level of penalty, but in some jurisdictions, the penalties are a percentage of a global and a world turnover, which is global sales, basically. So very different approaches. I would say that there's probably less advertising in the other parts of the world, and there is in the US, in part, these many parts of the world, advertising, we clearance for you this mandatory. That's an customization here. We've gone on the acquired, in some sectors, there are processes for voluntary crew clearance for you. And of course, if you're working with broadcast networks or if you're working with any major publisher, they're going to be around the site later than I take it off. And we sometimes see the media, the networks will raise challenges to broadcast ads. We'll go back and work with the network sometimes on those issues to see if we can get it through. But there are those important differences in the procedure that you need to keep in mind, especially if you're going to be advertising in the other part. Even our friends are rewarded and Canada have a different view, because they don't have the first amendment. So there are differences in how we look at advertising in the world. One of the biggest differences where we're arrested in the world has an advantage to arrest is they don't have a friendly environment for class actually losses. Even with better losses most of the rest of the world follows normal lose your payrolls. So unless you really think you have a strong case, it has not to be initiated. We don't have that because we have broad discovery, we get a lot of losses in the US and don't see that level of litigation typically in the rest of the world. I mentioned earlier the suffering of free procedures and there are suffering with free procedures, but those don't exist in all of the world. So through the ICC through the world federation of advertisers and the international advertising alliance, there are some international advertising groups. There are survey efforts that have been on the way for a number of years to build advertising self-regulation capacity to create broader awareness of best practices in advertising. Because when we think about advertising, advertising is the way to expand parties. And truthful advertising helps to promote Communists in markets. If you're not truthful about your ads, it's going to reduce confidence in market generally, but it's also going to call your entire sector in question. And so that's why we look at sometimes sectors specific, additional guidance to help people help industries really try to manage themselves and help educate them about the good rules and the road for fair advertising. So then everybody is also on a level of playing field. You're talking as I mentioned earlier is huge concern and one of the things we did this past year at the ICC is to develop a statement of COVID interpretation about what do we mean and the ICC when we talk about children and young people. So basically we align on 12 and younger or under 13 or children 13, 17 are teens, but for your category. So you need to care for not marketing to youth at all. The other threat that we see globally, again, that's not such a big issue here, probably called playing packaging issues. So Australian New Zealand, the UK, Ireland, and adopted generic packaging rules to adults, back up products. These proposals are spreading in other countries and in affecting categories other than tobacco. So we see the alcohol, beverage industry, certain parts of the food industry, employment, formula industry, and threat in my planning packaging issues. So international advertising bodies including the ICC have issued policy statements of jackdying to my packaging restrictions because it eliminates the ability to understand who we are getting the product from. And actually can result in much greater threats of counterfeit products all within their gamutching. One example of what the ICC has done in the electrical beverage industry and the alcohol beverage industry was facing a lot of threats to advertising a couple of years ago. One of their international trade associations came up with our request that the ICC consider and support what we call framework for response to the fact that we are doing. What for response to the marketing communication about the alcohol. The ICC has a number of what we call framework guys. The reason that we don't put it in the code is that the code is intended to be generally applicable to any kind of advertising. But where there are sectors who feel that there are additional guidance needed so we have framework guides on a partner or a meeting time. So for example, we have framework guides on our kids and children. We have a framework guide for a sponsoring working communication without alcohol. And some of the requirements of our standards that are embodied here are pretty just basic concepts twice. Only target people in the world who say don't appeal to private and community providers. And that can start from a point of an earlier, don't use curfews. Think about your techniques. Don't show minors breaking alcohol. In fact, for clients that I work with in some of the restricted categories. They would have rules so that if we are hiring actors. We might say okay, we only want to get 18 plus. So we might say you have to confirm that you are 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25 or 25. And that is a very important thing. And so we have a question that we have to do is in substantially older than that target age. Restrict entry. That's an easy one. Don't do promotions in contests that are attractive to or open to kids of 15. Because you're product is age restrictive. And then look at your demographics. So one of the common threats we see in the ones restrictions is that the industry cruise have self-abried to demographic limits. So for certain products like the alcohol never industry. You actually have to have an extraordinarily high percentage of adults in your market demographic. For that to be an acceptable venue for you to publish your article. So these are just basic techniques that I think you should consider for this industry. Because one thing I can say from my many years experience when the number type is you are under threat. And I think the political environment is so polarized now that the actions of the activists will probably increase as a way to keep the spotlight on things of current administration isn't doing. So my bottom line is the extension to a place. Don't be deceptive in this way you're on a fair. When you advertise you're really thinking about what is the impact on my sector. You're all in together. You're in a growing and non-industry. Bad practices by one company will have a magnified attitude. In fact, I'm a rest of the industry. Look at what happened. Look at alcohol. Look at tobacco master's son's rhythm. Look at what other industries have done. The scrutiny they came under and think about what are the gaps in the gap in the report center. Don't want to feel the underrated users. And all this is building to potentially, would you benefit from looking at how you're on the industry code? You certainly had a lot of experience doing that. I'm happy. Almost out of my time here. Happy to talk to you at a later time about what that might look like. But we have certainly found that the ability of industry to co-must around good standards and present in very responsive front and be extremely helpful to the industry's hold. So that's a tremendous amount. We have a number two for any questions. Okay. Any questions? All right.

For a few years, my mind was smoking and driving. I used to step outside the car every time, do you have a smoke? I started smoking cigarettes, when I was about 17, 18, when I was in the military, I really started smoking them regularly because they were available and they were easy. It was cool at the time. The effects of my daily life was smoking were something about 5-6 years because of the smell. Plus a few girlfriends behind it, a lot of money, a lot of money. Hi, I'm Adam Bowen, co-founder and CTO of Chual Labs. I'm James Moths, I'm the co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Chual Labs. So we started the company and held adults' motors. I think the light bulb moment was just talking about it and as we were talking about it, we realized there is a principle that can be applied here called harm reduction, which is basically keeping the quote good and remove the bad. What we found very quickly was this concept of vaporization, low temperature heating of products, to the point where you've advertised compounds that you're actually looking for without volatizing compounds that you don't. And so we pioneered this new type of chemistry called nicotine salts that really gives you that sensation of smoking a cigarette. So this is a jewel. It's very simple. There's a cartridge called a gel pod that contains our gel liquid pod inserts into the device and you take a puffed mango. There's nothing that really compares to the satisfaction of seeing a smoker, a long-term smoker, pick up jewel, quit smoking and know that they're never going to go back. They kind of discussed me when I see them because it's like, I've been there, I know the smell and I'm just more satisfied with this. To that point, I tried all other products in the market but after I switched to gel and I was like, thank god there's a company who's stand by their product. I was set fired in a little tabo go. I'm playing jewel for this because they should have made this year's a go open. I think I would come for that because they did a great job.\"),\n"," ('https://archive.org/download/tobacco_hhmf0299/hhmf0299.mp4',\n","  \" Oh no, that was my friend Bart. He just got fired.
